   <h1><span>question-1 : </span>Diffrent between var let and const.</h1>
  <h3> Ans =></h3>
  var --something that if you assign something, after if you want re-assign new value you can do this and you also able to use this value globally. That is why is is not a block scop.
  <hr>
  let --something that if you assign something, after if you want re-assign new value you can do this but the value of let you can not use out side of a block, that is why it is called a block scope
  <hr>
  const --something that if you assign something, after if you want re-assign new value you can not do this and the value of const you can not use out side of a block, that is why it is called a block scope

    <h1><span>question-2 : </span>Diffrent between arrow and regular function</h1>
    <h3> Ans =></h3>
    regular function ---Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value (aka the execution context) is dynamic.
    <hr>
    arrow function ---The behavior of this inside of an arrow function differs considerably from the regular function's this behavior. The arrow function doesn't define its own execution context.

    No matter how or where being executed, this value inside of an arrow function always equals this value from the outer function. In other words, the arrow function resolves this lexically.

        <h1><span>question-2 : </span> what is Template literals ?</h1>
        template string ---Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, for string interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called tagged templates.

        Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.
